# Repo description
This repository contains different interesting functions and just a code that can help to solve
usual and work problems. There is two branches: **code** contains scripts and necessary files and **exe**
that stores .exe files, so you can just click to these files and code will do their work. It's so simple, isn't it? ^_^

# Convert jpg to pdf
It's a very simple function that converts all **.jpg** images that have the same location as script or .exe file to
**.pdf** image (its name - current date). But you can waste less time, just run code, 
you won't search the same service in the Internet.

# Retry urls
It's a script that takes a **.txt** file that contains all urls you want to check/validate. It will return
a **log.txt** with all invalid urls inside. Amount of retries is 5 by default.
